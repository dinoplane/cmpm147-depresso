# Sweet Depresso
A p5.js project by Arrian Chi, Jane Tran, and Randy Le. <br/>

## Uses of Procedural Generation
- The maze: We used a randomized, iterative algorithm of depth-first search to generate the maze. <br/>
- The students: Given some colors for each article of clothing, each student within a generated maze has a unique set of clothes. <br/>
- The coffee: Each time the player restocks on coffee, the cups are stacked differently. <br/>
